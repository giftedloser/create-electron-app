## Installation

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd create-my-electron-app
npm install
npm link

## Usage

Run anywhere in your terminal:

```bash
create-my-electron-app
```

Follow the interactive wizard to configure:

* Project metadata (name, author, license, description)
* Core features (React, TypeScript, Electron, AD/SSO, SQLite, etc.)
* Dev tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Git hooks)
* Build and packaging scripts
* Advanced options (window size, resizable, dark mode, custom title bar)

---

## Generated Project Structure

After completion, your project folder includes:

* `src/` - Electron main process and frontend sources
* `public/` - Static assets including `index.html`
* `package.json` - with all scripts and dependencies
* `.prettierrc` and `.eslintrc` - code style configs
* Modular feature files (e.g., `db.js` for SQLite)
* Config files, README, and roadmap documents

---

## Development

* Source code organized under `src/`
* Templates under `templates/` with `base/` and feature-specific folders
* CLI prompts in `src/wizard.js`
* Project scaffolding logic in `src/generator.js`
* Utilities in `src/utils/`
